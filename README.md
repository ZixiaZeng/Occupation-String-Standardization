The end-to-end processing flow progresses through: 

1. Rule-based preprocessing for abbreviation expansion, spelling correction, family relationship tagging and multiple occupation detection;
2. Confidence assessment using composite similarity algorithms with additional adjustment;
3. Intelligent LLM triage decisions based on multi-criteria evaluation;
4. Multi-occupation processing;
5. Data aggregation and contextualization;
6. Integration with fine-tuned OccCANINE for HISCO classification.
